# Prompt Repeater Settings

This file configures automatic prompt repetition for non-reasoning tasks.

## Quick Start

To enable automatic repetition:

1. Copy this file to `.claude/prompt-repeater.local.md`
2. Change `auto_apply: false` to `auto_apply: true`
3. Restart Claude Code

## Configuration Options

### auto_apply

Controls whether prompts are automatically repeated.

- `false` (default): No automatic repetition. Use `/repeat-last`, `/repeat-verbose`, or `/repeat-3x` commands manually
- `true`: Automatically apply repetition to every prompt based on `default_mode`

**When to enable:**
- You frequently work with non-reasoning tasks (lists, multiple choice)
- You want maximum performance without manual commands
- You understand when repetition helps vs. when it doesn't

**When to keep disabled:**
- You prefer manual control via commands
- You work primarily with complex reasoning tasks
- You want to selectively apply repetition

### default_mode

Choose which repetition variant to use when `auto_apply: true`.

- **`simple`** (recommended): `<QUERY><QUERY>` - Best default, works well for most tasks
- **`verbose`**: `<QUERY> Let me repeat that: <QUERY>` - Sometimes marginally better
- **`triple`**: Three repetitions - Maximum accuracy for list navigation, but longer input

**Recommendations:**
- Start with `simple` for general use
- Use `triple` if you frequently work with long lists or complex pattern matching
- Use `verbose` if you prefer more natural framing

### notify

Controls whether you see a notification when repetition is applied.

- `true` (default): Show "🔁 Auto-repetition applied (mode: simple)" message
- `false`: Silent mode - repetition happens without notification

**Recommendations:**
- Keep `true` initially to understand when repetition is being applied
- Switch to `false` once you're comfortable with automatic mode

## Example Configurations

### Conservative (Manual Control)

```yaml
---
auto_apply: false
default_mode: simple
notify: true
---
```

Use commands (`/repeat-last`, `/repeat-3x`) to manually apply repetition when needed.

### Balanced (Auto Simple)

```yaml
---
auto_apply: true
default_mode: simple
notify: true
---
```

Automatically apply simple repetition to all prompts. Good for mixed workloads.

### Aggressive (Auto Triple)

```yaml
---
auto_apply: true
default_mode: triple
notify: false
---
```

Maximum accuracy for list-heavy work. Silent operation for experienced users.

### Silent Simple

```yaml
---
auto_apply: true
default_mode: simple
notify: false
---
```

Automatic repetition without notifications. Clean interface.

## When Auto-Apply Helps

Enable `auto_apply: true` when you frequently work with:

- ✅ Multiple choice questions
- ✅ List navigation (find Nth, find between items)
- ✅ Simple queries and fact retrieval
- ✅ Pattern matching tasks

## When to Keep Manual

Keep `auto_apply: false` and use commands when:

- ⚠️ You work primarily with complex reasoning tasks
- ⚠️ You want selective control over when repetition applies
- ⚠️ You're experimenting to understand when it helps
- ⚠️ Your prompts are often very long (context limits)

## Toggling On/Off

**To enable:**
1. Set `auto_apply: true` in this file
2. Restart Claude Code

**To disable:**
1. Set `auto_apply: false` in this file
2. Restart Claude Code

**Or delete the file entirely** to disable automatic repetition.

## Research Background

Based on Google Research paper "Prompt Repetition Improves Non-Reasoning LLMs":
- 47 wins, 0 losses on benchmarks
- No latency penalty
- Especially effective for list tasks (21% → 97% accuracy)
- Safe even with reasoning tasks (neutral to slightly positive)

See the prompt-repetition-optimization skill for detailed guidance on when repetition helps.

## Troubleshooting

**Repetition not applying:**
- Check that this file is named `.claude/prompt-repeater.local.md` (not `.example`)
- Verify `auto_apply: true` is set
- Restart Claude Code (hooks load at session start)

**Want different modes for different tasks:**
- Keep `auto_apply: false`
- Use `/repeat-last`, `/repeat-verbose`, or `/repeat-3x` commands selectively

**Repetition applying when you don't want it:**
- Set `auto_apply: false` and restart Claude Code
- Or delete this file entirely
